## Ideas Backlog

| # | Idea | From | Priority | Status | Added |
|:-:|------|------|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|
| 1 | Permission-aware field officer home dashboard — today's collections, work queue, meetings, portfolio, quick actions; every card gated by the user's Fineract permissions (feature `home`; search moves to feature `search`) | Operator, Fineract permission/API audit | P0 | Scaffolded | 2026-10-26 |
| 2 | Offline sync (Settings → Offline sync, separate from Sync & Drafts) — select centres / groups / clients and a background job downloads each one's full downstream tree (closed accounts and document files included); download-only — offline actions are drafts that Sync & Drafts uploads; live dashboard of everything on the device at three levels (Centre / Group / Client) with per-record sync status; Manual or Automatic sync of the chosen records (feature `offlineSync`) | Operator, redesign of 6b66e8a43 feature/offline | P1 | Scaffolded | 2026-10-27 |
| 3 | Profile, opened from the Home avatar — who is signed in (full name, username, Loan officer / Staff, office, roles), what Home shows (my portfolio vs office), the live server session, Change password and Sign out; offline shows the identity saved at sign-in (feature `profile`) | Operator, after the drawer was removed | P1 | Scaffolded | 2026-10-27 |
| 4 | First-run onboarding before sign-in — three intro pages (clients/groups/centres in the field, repayments and collection sheets, offline and sync later) and a privacy page asking for usage-analytics and crash-report consent, both OFF by default; shown once (feature `onboarding`) | Operator, privacy plan "analytics off until consent" | P1 | Scaffolded | 2026-11-04 |
