Design the content state of the Offline sync screen for **Mifos X Field Officer**, a microfinance field-officer app that keeps centres, groups and clients on the device so the officer can work where there is no signal. Material 3 light theme, responsive layout (phone is the compact reference, not the canvas), the design system's own type scale (do not change the font). Responsive: fluid full-width layout with no fixed-width root and no phone-width max-width cap; use Tailwind md:/lg: breakpoints. Compact (<600dp): one column in the order Summary, On this device, Sync, cards full width minus 16dp insets, extended FAB bottom-right. Medium (600-840dp): two-column list-detail, a left column about 360dp wide holding the Summary card above the Sync card, and a right column filling the rest with the On this device card (rows wider, trailing actions right aligned), 24dp gutters. Expanded (>=840dp): the same two columns centred in a content area capped near 1200dp, left column 400dp, the inventory card gets more breathing room; the FAB stays bottom-right of the content area.

Palette: background #FAFAFB, surface #FFFFFF, onSurface #0F172A, onSurfaceVariant #475569, primary #4338CA, onPrimary #FFFFFF, primaryContainer #E0E7FF, onPrimaryContainer #1F1D75, secondary #059669, secondaryContainer #D1FAE5, tertiary #D97706, tertiaryContainer #FEF3C7, error #DC2626, outline #94A3B8, outlineVariant #CBD5E1.

Shell: this is a Settings sub-screen. Top app bar with a back arrow and the title only, spanning the full window width at every size. NO bottom navigation bar, NO drawer, NO tabs in the app bar. One extended FAB.

**Component 1 - Top App Bar** (64dp tall, full width, background #FAFAFB): leading back-arrow icon #475569, title "Offline sync" semibold title-large #0F172A, left aligned. No trailing actions.

**Component 2 - Summary Card** (16dp radius, surface #FFFFFF, 1dp #CBD5E1 border, soft shadow, 16dp padding, 12dp vertical gap): a chip row with "Online" (secondaryContainer #D1FAE5, a small #064E3B dot) and "3 to sync" (tertiaryContainer #FEF3C7, sync-problem icon). Below, three equal level tiles in one row, each 12dp radius on #FAFAFB with a 1dp #E2E8F0 border: big number then caption with icon: "2" Centres, "5" Groups, "43" Clients, numbers tabular. Caption "Last synced 2 h ago, Manual" in #475569. Full-width 48dp pill button "Sync now" filled #4338CA with a sync icon.

**Component 3 - On this device Card** (same card style, list_screen archetype, rows 68dp tall with 40dp rounded-square initials avatars, indented child rows 56dp tall with 32dp avatars on #FBFBFD): heading "On this device" semibold. A Chip Row of three level tabs, 36dp tall, 8dp radius: "Centres 2" selected (primaryContainer #E0E7FF fill, #4338CA border), "Groups 5" and "Clients 43" outlined #CBD5E1. Then divided rows, each with an avatar (#E0E7FF for centres, #F3E8FF for groups), name, a counts line in #475569 and a small status line with icon. Row one: Arin Savings, counts 2 groups and 11 clients, status Waiting to sync, chosen just now, in #4338CA with a clock icon, trailing delete icon and expand chevron. Row two: Centro Arin, counts 3 groups, 31 clients and 74 accounts, status Synced 2 h ago in #059669 with a check-circle icon, trailing refresh icon and a collapse chevron because it is expanded. Under it, three indented group rows each with a trailing chevron: MARIPOSAS MONARCAS with status 12 clients, synced in #059669; Las Margaritas with status 10 clients, synced in #059669; Girasoles with status 9 clients, 2 failed in #DC2626 with an error icon.

**Component 4 - Sync Card** (same card style): heading "Sync". A two-option segmented control in a #E2E8F0 pill track: "Manual" selected (white thumb, touch icon) and "Automatic" (schedule icon). Two info lines in #475569 with leading icons: "Your records sync only when you tap Sync now. Do it before you head out." and "Syncing downloads a lot of data. Only the records you chose come to this device."

**Component 5 - Extended FAB** (56dp tall, 16dp radius, primaryContainer #E0E7FF, onPrimaryContainer label, anchored bottom-right with 24dp margin): plus icon and "Add records".

DO NOT add a hero banner, percentages, KPI sparklines or any "ready" score. DO NOT show anything about uploads, payloads, queues or pending transactions; this screen only downloads. DO NOT render a bottom navigation bar or invent sections not listed. DO NOT use em-dash characters anywhere.

Calm, practical and trustworthy: white cards on a soft #FAFAFB page with the indigo #4338CA reserved for the one primary action and the selected tab, so the officer reads at a glance what is on the device and what still needs syncing.
