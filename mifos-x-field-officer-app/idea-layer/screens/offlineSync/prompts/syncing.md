Design the syncing state of the Offline sync screen for **Mifos X Field Officer**, a microfinance field-officer app that keeps centres, groups and clients on the device so the officer can work where there is no signal. Material 3 light theme, responsive layout (phone is the compact reference, not the canvas), the design system's own type scale (do not change the font). Responsive: fluid full-width layout with no fixed-width root and no phone-width max-width cap; use Tailwind md:/lg: breakpoints. Compact (<600dp): one column in the order Summary, Active Job, On this device, Sync, cards full width minus 16dp insets, extended FAB bottom-right. Medium (600-840dp): two-column list-detail, a left column about 360dp wide stacking Summary, Active Job and Sync, and a right column filling the rest with the On this device card, 24dp gutters. Expanded (>=840dp): the same two columns centred in a content area capped near 1200dp, left column 400dp, the inventory rows wider with their progress bars stretching; the FAB stays bottom-right of the content area.

Palette: background #FAFAFB, surface #FFFFFF, onSurface #0F172A, onSurfaceVariant #475569, primary #4338CA, onPrimary #FFFFFF, primaryContainer #E0E7FF, onPrimaryContainer #1F1D75, secondary #059669, secondaryContainer #D1FAE5, tertiary #D97706, tertiaryContainer #FEF3C7, error #DC2626, outline #94A3B8, outlineVariant #CBD5E1.

Shell: this is a Settings sub-screen. Top app bar with a back arrow and the title only, spanning the full window width. NO bottom navigation bar, NO drawer. One extended FAB.

**Component 1 - Top App Bar** (64dp tall, full width, background #FAFAFB): back arrow #475569, title "Offline sync" semibold title-large #0F172A.

**Component 2 - Summary Card** (16dp radius, surface #FFFFFF, 1dp #CBD5E1 border, 16dp padding): chips "Online, Wi-Fi" (#D1FAE5) and "Syncing 2" (#E0E7FF, sync icon). Three level tiles in one row: "2" Centres, "5" Groups, "43" Clients. Caption "Automatic, every 6 h, next at 16:00". Full-width 48dp pill button "Syncing..." disabled (#E2E8F0 fill, #94A3B8 label).

**Component 3 - Active Job Card** (2dp #4338CA border with a faint indigo glow, 16dp padding): 40dp #E0E7FF icon tile with a rotating sync icon, title "Downloading 2 records" semibold, subtitle "Arin Savings, Irving Zamora", trailing outlined pill button "Cancel". An 8dp rounded progress bar at 30% in #4338CA on #E2E8F0. A line "312 of 1,040 reads" with "~3 min left" right aligned. A step list: "Templates and products" done (check #059669, "7"), "Las Palomas, client loans" in progress (download icon #4338CA, "group 1 of 2"), "Irving Zamora" queued (#94A3B8).

**Component 4 - On this device Card** (list_screen archetype): heading "On this device", Chip Row "Centres 2" selected, "Groups 5", "Clients 43". Rows: "Arin Savings", "2 groups, 11 clients", status "Syncing... 38%" #4338CA with a thin 4dp progress bar under it; "Centro Arin", "3 groups, 31 clients, 74 accounts", status "Synced 2 h ago" #059669, trailing refresh icon and expand chevron.

**Component 5 - Sync Card**: segmented control with "Automatic" selected. Label "Re-sync your records", then interval chips "Every 1 h", "Every 6 h" (selected, #E0E7FF with #4338CA border), "Every 12 h", "Every 24 h". Two switch rows: "Wi-Fi only" ON (#4338CA track) and "Only while charging" OFF. Info line "Syncing downloads a lot of data. Only the records you chose come to this device."

**Component 6 - Extended FAB** (56dp, 16dp radius, #E0E7FF, bottom-right): plus icon and "Add records".

DO NOT add a hero banner, percentages other than the job and row progress, or any "ready" score. DO NOT show uploads, payloads, queues or pending transactions; this screen only downloads. DO NOT render a bottom navigation bar or invent sections. DO NOT use em-dash characters anywhere.

Focused and reassuring: one indigo-outlined job card carries the live motion while everything else stays calm white, so the officer sees progress without the screen feeling busy.
