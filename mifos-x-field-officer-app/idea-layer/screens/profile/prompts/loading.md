Design the loading state of the Profile screen for **Mifos X Field Officer**, a microfinance field-officer app. The account saved at sign-in shows at once; only the officer's full name and email are still arriving from the server. Material 3 light theme, **responsive layout** that works on phones, tablets and desktop windows, the design system's own type scale (do not change the font). Responsive layout (required): fluid full-width layout, no fixed-width root and no phone-width max-width cap. Compact (<600dp): one column in the order below with 16dp side margins. Medium (600-840dp): two columns with a 24dp gutter; the left column holds the Identity Header and Roles, the right column stacks the Office and Signed in to cards; the top app bar spans the full width. Expanded (>=840dp): the same two columns inside a centred content column capped at about 1040dp (left column about 360dp wide), 32dp side margins. The shimmer bars keep their proportions inside each column. Use Tailwind md: and lg: breakpoints.

Palette: background #FAFAFB, surface #FFFFFF, onSurface #0F172A, onSurfaceVariant #475569, primary #4338CA, primaryContainer #E0E7FF, surfaceVariant #E2E8F0, outlineVariant #CBD5E1.

Shell: a detail screen opened from the Home avatar. Top app bar with a back arrow and the title only. NO bottom navigation bar, NO drawer, NO FAB.

**Component 1 - Top App Bar** (64dp tall, background #FAFAFB): back arrow, title "Profile" semibold title-large #0F172A.

**Component 2 - Identity Header** (no card, left aligned, 16dp gap, shimmer bars with 6dp rounded ends in a soft #E2E8F0 to #FAFAFB gradient): a 72dp circle avatar on primaryContainer #E0E7FF with the single letter "F" bold #4338CA. Beside it a 28dp tall shimmer bar about 70% wide where the name will be, then the username "fieldofficer" in body-medium #475569, then a thinner shimmer bar about 55% wide.

**Component 3 - Office Card** (16dp radius, white, 1dp #CBD5E1 border, 56dp rows with 1dp #E2E8F0 dividers): a row with an apartment icon, label "Office", value "CENTRAL"; a row with an insights icon, label "What Home shows" and a short shimmer bar in place of its value.

**Component 4 - Roles** (section heading "Roles" #475569 above a card of the same style): one outlined 32dp chip with an 8dp radius, a badge icon #4338CA and the role "OFICIAL DE CAMPO".

**Component 5 - Signed In Card** (section heading "Signed in to", same card style): a row with the instance "Mifos field officer gateway"; a row with label "Server", value "https://apis.mifos.community/1.0/field/v1/"; a row with label "Tenant", value "mifos-bank-1".

Nothing below the Signed In Card: leave calm empty background. DO NOT add a footer, a caption, a security note or any text not listed. DO NOT show a full-screen spinner or a progress bar; the screen is usable while the name loads. DO NOT render a bottom navigation bar or a FAB. DO NOT use em-dash characters anywhere.

Already there: the officer recognises their own account the moment the screen opens on the indigo #4338CA initial, with only two quiet bars still filling in.
