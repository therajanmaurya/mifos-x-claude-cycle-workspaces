Design the error state of the Profile screen for **Mifos X Field Officer**, a microfinance field-officer app. The server could not return the officer's full name, so the screen keeps everything saved at sign-in and shows one inline error with a retry. This is NOT a full-screen error. Material 3 light theme, **responsive layout** that works on phones, tablets and desktop windows, the design system's own type scale (do not change the font). Responsive layout (required): fluid full-width layout, no fixed-width root and no phone-width max-width cap. Compact (<600dp): one column in the order below with 16dp side margins. Medium (600-840dp): two columns with a 24dp gutter; the left column holds the Identity Header, the Inline Error directly under it, and Roles; the right column stacks the Office, Signed in to and Account cards; the top app bar spans the full width. Expanded (>=840dp): the same two columns inside a centred content column capped at about 1040dp (left column about 360dp wide), 32dp side margins. Use Tailwind md: and lg: breakpoints.

Palette: background #FAFAFB, surface #FFFFFF, onSurface #0F172A, onSurfaceVariant #475569, primary #4338CA, primaryContainer #E0E7FF, secondaryContainer #D1FAE5, error #DC2626, errorContainer #FFE4E1, onErrorContainer #9F1239, outlineVariant #CBD5E1.

Shell: a detail screen opened from the Home avatar. Top app bar with a back arrow and the title only. NO bottom navigation bar, NO drawer, NO FAB.

**Component 1 - Top App Bar** (64dp tall, background #FAFAFB): back arrow, title "Profile" semibold title-large #0F172A.

**Component 2 - Identity Header** (no card, left aligned, 16dp gap): a 72dp circle avatar on primaryContainer #E0E7FF with the letter "F" bold #4338CA. Beside it the username "fieldofficer" semibold headline-small #0F172A and the office "CENTRAL" in body-medium #475569.

**Component 3 - Inline Error** (directly under the header, 12dp radius, errorContainer #FFE4E1, onErrorContainer #9F1239, 8dp by 16dp padding): an error icon, the message "Couldn't load your name from the server." with a smaller second line "Server error (500). Try again.", and a trailing text button "Retry" semibold #DC2626.

**Component 4 - Office Card** (16dp radius, white, 1dp #CBD5E1 border, 56dp rows with 1dp #E2E8F0 dividers): a row with label "Office", value "CENTRAL"; a row with label "What Home shows", value "Office: CENTRAL", and the supporting line "Your own portfolio when you're linked to a staff record, otherwise your whole office."

**Component 5 - Roles** (section heading "Roles", same card style): one outlined 32dp chip with an 8dp radius and the role "OFICIAL DE CAMPO".

**Component 6 - Signed In Card** (section heading "Signed in to", same card style): the instance "Mifos field officer gateway" with a 22dp "Live" pill (#D1FAE5); a row with label "Server", value "https://apis.mifos.community/1.0/field/v1/"; a row with label "Tenant", value "mifos-bank-1"; the link "Server settings" #4338CA with a chevron.

**Component 7 - Account Card** (same card style): a row "Change password" with a chevron; a row "Sign out" in error #DC2626.

DO NOT replace the screen with an empty error illustration; DO NOT hide the sections below the error. DO NOT render a bottom navigation bar or a FAB. DO NOT use em-dash characters anywhere.

Contained: one rose #DC2626 strip names the single thing that failed, and the rest of the account stays readable and usable around it.
