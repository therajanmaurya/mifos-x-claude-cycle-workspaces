Design the offline state of the Profile screen for **Mifos X Field Officer**, a microfinance field-officer app used where there is often no signal. The whole account still shows from what was saved at sign-in; only Change password needs a connection. Material 3 light theme, **responsive layout** that works on phones, tablets and desktop windows, the design system's own type scale (do not change the font). Responsive layout (required): fluid full-width layout, no fixed-width root and no phone-width max-width cap. Compact (<600dp): one column in the order below with 16dp side margins. Medium (600-840dp): the Offline Banner spans the full content width under the top app bar, then two columns with a 24dp gutter; the left column holds the Identity Header and Roles, the right column stacks the Office, Signed in to and Account cards. Expanded (>=840dp): the banner and the same two columns inside a centred content column capped at about 1040dp (left column about 360dp wide), 32dp side margins. Use Tailwind md: and lg: breakpoints.

Palette: background #FAFAFB, surface #FFFFFF, onSurface #0F172A, onSurfaceVariant #475569, primary #4338CA, primaryContainer #E0E7FF, tertiaryContainer #FEF3C7, onTertiaryContainer #78350F, error #DC2626, outline #94A3B8, outlineVariant #CBD5E1.

Shell: a detail screen opened from the Home avatar. Top app bar with a back arrow and the title only. NO bottom navigation bar, NO drawer, NO FAB.

**Component 1 - Top App Bar** (64dp tall, background #FAFAFB): back arrow, title "Profile" semibold title-large #0F172A.

**Component 2 - Offline Banner** (full content width minus 16dp insets, 12dp radius, tertiaryContainer #FEF3C7, onTertiaryContainer #78350F, 12dp by 16dp padding): cloud-off icon and "You're offline. This is the account saved when you signed in."

**Component 3 - Identity Header** (no card, left aligned, 16dp gap): a 72dp circle avatar on primaryContainer #E0E7FF with "IZ" bold #4338CA; the name "Irving Zepeda" semibold headline-small, then the username "fieldofficer" and the email "oficial.campo@gmail.com" in body-medium #475569.

**Component 4 - Office Card** (16dp radius, white, 1dp #CBD5E1 border, 56dp rows with 1dp #E2E8F0 dividers): a row with label "Office", value "CENTRAL"; a row with label "What Home shows", value "Office: CENTRAL", and its supporting line.

**Component 5 - Roles** (section heading "Roles", same card style): one outlined 32dp chip with the role "OFICIAL DE CAMPO".

**Component 6 - Signed In Card** (section heading "Signed in to", same card style): the instance "Mifos field officer gateway" with NO Live pill; a row with label "Server", value "https://apis.mifos.community/1.0/field/v1/"; a row with label "Tenant", value "mifos-bank-1"; the link "Server settings" #4338CA.

**Component 7 - Account Card** (same card style): a row "Change password" DISABLED, icon and label in outline #94A3B8 with the supporting line "Connect to the internet to change your password." and no chevron; a row "Sign out" in error #DC2626, still enabled.

DO NOT show an error or a retry; being offline is a normal field condition. DO NOT render a bottom navigation bar or a FAB. DO NOT use em-dash characters anywhere.

Steady: one amber #FEF3C7 banner states the condition, and the account below is complete and calm.
